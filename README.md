### MINI L3 Robot

## Basic setup:

1. Turn on transmitter, center all sticks
2. Zero knee and hip joints (especially the hip)
3. Plug in power to teensy through MicroUSB
4. Plug in 2S battery to XT-30 connector
5. Turn off "Safety" on transmitter by flipping top right switch down. If safety is on, no commands will go through and motors will be fixed in "coasting" mode.
6. Once safety is off, left stick up/down controls hip position, right stick up/down controls wheel velocity, and right stick left/right controls knee velocity (by incrementing position)
